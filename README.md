## **Project Overview**  

### **Introduction**  
This project explores how **Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)** can be used to predict the amount an individual is likely to spend on a car based on key financial and demographic factors. Using a structured dataset, the model learns patterns and relationships between input features such as **age, salary, net worth, and credit card debt** to make precise predictions.

## **Motivation and Purpose**  
Predicting consumer spending behavior is a crucial application of machine learning, particularly in industries such as **automobile sales, finance, and marketing**. This project was developed to:  

- Gain hands-on experience with **Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)** in real-world predictive analytics.  
- Understand how **financial and demographic data** influence car purchase behavior.  
- Experiment with different **ANN architectures** and **hyperparameters** for improved model accuracy.

## **Problem Statement and Objectives**  

### **Problem Statement:**  
Many factors influence how much a person is willing to spend on a car, including their **income, debt, and net worth**. However, manually assessing these relationships can be challenging. The objective of this project is to use **machine learning** to automate and optimize **car purchase predictions** based on relevant financial and personal factors.  

### **Objectives:**  
‚úîÔ∏è Train an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** to predict **car purchase amounts** based on user data.  
‚úîÔ∏è Experiment with different **network architectures, activation functions, and optimizers**.  
‚úîÔ∏è Evaluate **model performance** using loss curves and validation metrics.  
‚úîÔ∏è Deploy the trained model to make **real-time predictions**.

## **Dataset Description**  
The dataset used for this project includes the following key features:  

| Feature | Description |  
|---------|------------|  
| **Gender** | Binary (0 = Female, 1 = Male) |  
| **Age** | Age of the individual |  
| **Annual Salary** | Yearly income in USD |  
| **Credit Card Debt** | Total credit card debt in USD |  
| **Net Worth** | Total financial net worth in USD |  
| **Car Purchase Amount (Target)** | Amount the individual is expected to spend on a car |  

üìå **Data Preprocessing Steps:**  
- **Normalization**: Scaled numerical values to a common range for better ANN performance.  
- **Handling Missing Values**: Checked and filled any missing data appropriately.  
- **Feature Engineering**: Selected the most relevant predictors.
